Logic gates, Boolean algebra theorems and properties, logical functions with canonical and standard forms, logic minimization using Boolean algebra and K-maps are addressed. Then, the course presents design methodologies of combinational circuits that lead to relevant gate-level diagrams such as adders, subtractors, multipliers, comparators, decoders, encoders, multiplexers, and demultiplexers. Sequential circuits starting with latches and flip-flops are introduced. Subsequently, registers and counters are presented. Design of synchronous sequential circuits with relevant schematic diagrams are then addressed. Finite State Machines (FSMs) with state equivalence and minimization are also introduced. Finally, introduction to memory and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) is presented.",

It also covers the critical features of real‑time operating systems (RTOS), such as multi-tasking, process management, scheduling of periodic, aperiodic, and sporadic tasks, interprocess communication and synchronization, real‑time memory management, clocks and timers, interrupts and exceptions handling, message queues, and asynchronous input/output. Students learn how to program POSIX real-time, periodic, aperiodic, and sporadic threads by using concurrent programming languages and a real-time development environment. Moreover, this course covers real‑time uniprocessor scheduling policies: static vs. dynamic, pre‑emptive vs. non‑pre‑emptive scheduling algorithms, and some specific techniques — rate‑monotonic, earliest‑deadline‑first, deadline monotonic, least‑laxity‑time‑first; clock‑driven scheduling.

The project is completed by a team of students from at least two differentdepartments in GCS. The project must provide clear goals for each discipline-specific taskand each student must have sufficient exposure to subjects in their program of study.Student eligibility and project topics for this course are subject to approval by the ENGR490 Design Committee, which includes a member from each department in GCS thatoffers undergraduate programs. This committee vets each project to ensure the clarity andscope of the goals and its relevance to the learning outcomes of students from eachdiscipline.The project is carried out over both fall and winter terms. Students are expected to providea preliminary project proposal, a progress and a final report (as a group); take part ingroup discussions in audit sessions during the design phase; and participate in a postersession involving individual oral presentations at the end of the winter term. In addition tothe technical aspects, students are expected to learn how to evaluate their designs forcompliance to regulations, environmental and societal expectations and economic issues.Students learn how to work in a multidisciplinary environment and receive exposure toentrepreneurial skills. Lectures: one hour per week, two terms. Equivalent laboratory time:three hours per week, two terms.NOTE: Students work in groups under direct supervision of a faculty member.",
