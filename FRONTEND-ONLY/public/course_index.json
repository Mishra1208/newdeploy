Then, the course presents design methodologies of combinational circuits that lead to relevant gate-level diagrams such as adders, subtractors, multipliers, comparators, decoders, encoders, multiplexers, and demultiplexers. Sequential circuits starting with latches and flip-flops are introduced. Subsequently, registers and counters are presented. Design of synchronous sequential circuits with relevant schematic diagrams are then addressed. Finite State Machines (FSMs) with state equivalence and minimization are also introduced. Finally, introduction to memory and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) is presented."

It provides students with the basics of the analysis and the design of digital VLSI circuits with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Students are exposed to the physical structures of CMOS circuits, CMOS processing technology and design rules, computer-aided design (CAD) issues, interconnections, and input/output problems. In particular, they acquire the knowledge about physical layers and parasitic elements of CMOS circuits to understand how such elements are related to the performance of VLSI circuits. Students also learn the characterization of integrated devices and the performance evaluation of VLSI circuits. Constraints on speed, power dissipation and silicon space consumption are discussed. The course work includes a mini design/implementation project using a specified CMOS technology."

There will be various assignments in which students will be involved in research projects. Knowledge of telecommunication systems and a background in network simulation is needed. Project."

The project is completed by a team of students from at least two differentdepartments in GCS. The project must provide clear goals for each discipline-specific taskand each student must have sufficient exposure to subjects in their program of study.Student eligibility and project topics for this course are subject to approval by the ENGR490 Design Committee, which includes a member from each department in GCS thatoffers undergraduate programs. This committee vets each project to ensure the clarity andscope of the goals and its relevance to the learning outcomes of students from eachdiscipline.The project is carried out over both fall and winter terms. Students are expected to providea preliminary project proposal, a progress and a final report (as a group); take part ingroup discussions in audit sessions during the design phase; and participate in a postersession involving individual oral presentations at the end of the winter term. In addition tothe technical aspects, students are expected to learn how to evaluate their designs forcompliance to regulations, environmental and societal expectations and economic issues.Students learn how to work in a multidisciplinary environment and receive exposure toentrepreneurial skills. Lectures: one hour per week, two terms. Equivalent laboratory time:three hours per week, two terms.NOTE: Students work in groups under direct supervision of a faculty member."

Then, the course presents design methodologies of combinational circuits that lead to relevant gate-level diagrams such as adders, subtractors, multipliers, comparators, decoders, encoders, multiplexers, and demultiplexers. Sequential circuits starting with latches and flip-flops are introduced. Subsequently, registers and counters are presented. Design of synchronous sequential circuits with relevant schematic diagrams are then addressed. Finite State Machines (FSMs) with state equivalence and minimization are also introduced. Finally, introduction to memory and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) is presented."

Students learn how to program POSIX real-time, periodic, aperiodic, and sporadic threads by using concurrent programming languages and a real-time development environment. Moreover, this course covers real‑time uniprocessor scheduling policies: static vs. dynamic, pre‑emptive vs. non‑pre‑emptive scheduling algorithms, and some specific techniques — rate‑monotonic, earliest‑deadline‑first, deadline monotonic, least‑laxity‑time‑first; clock‑driven scheduling. Techniques used to design, model, and specify real-time systems, such as finite state machines, UML state machines, and Petri and Timed Petri Networks, are introduced.

It provides students with the basics of the analysis and the design of digital VLSI circuits with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Students are exposed to the physical structures of CMOS circuits, CMOS processing technology and design rules, computer-aided design (CAD) issues, interconnections, and input/output problems. In particular, they acquire the knowledge about physical layers and parasitic elements of CMOS circuits to understand how such elements are related to the performance of VLSI circuits. Students also learn the characterization of integrated devices and the performance evaluation of VLSI circuits. Constraints on speed, power dissipation and silicon space consumption are discussed. The course work includes a mini design/implementation project using a specified CMOS technology."

The project is completed by a team of students from at least two differentdepartments in GCS. The project must provide clear goals for each discipline-specific taskand each student must have sufficient exposure to subjects in their program of study.Student eligibility and project topics for this course are subject to approval by the ENGR490 Design Committee, which includes a member from each department in GCS thatoffers undergraduate programs. This committee vets each project to ensure the clarity andscope of the goals and its relevance to the learning outcomes of students from eachdiscipline.The project is carried out over both fall and winter terms. Students are expected to providea preliminary project proposal, a progress and a final report (as a group); take part ingroup discussions in audit sessions during the design phase; and participate in a postersession involving individual oral presentations at the end of the winter term. In addition tothe technical aspects, students are expected to learn how to evaluate their designs forcompliance to regulations, environmental and societal expectations and economic issues.Students learn how to work in a multidisciplinary environment and receive exposure toentrepreneurial skills. Lectures: one hour per week, two terms. Equivalent laboratory time:three hours per week, two terms.NOTE: Students work in groups under direct supervision of a faculty member."
